You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports; for example, a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). 1.1 Usage Each bookdown chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter must start with a first-level heading: # A good chapter, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading. Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: ## A short section or ### An even shorter section. The index.Rmd file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book. 1.2 Render book You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything: Find the Build pane in the RStudio IDE, and Click on Build Book, then select your output format, or select “All formats” if you’d like to use multiple formats from the same book source files. Or build the book from the R console: bookdown::render_book() To render this example to PDF as a bookdown::pdf_book, you’ll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.org/tinytex/. 1.3 Preview book As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in “Preview book”, or from the R console: bookdown::serve_book() "],["ndvi-calculation-with-sentinel-2-in-google-earth-engine.html", "Chapter 2 NDVI Calculation with Sentinel-2 in Google Earth Engine 2.1 Introduction 2.2 Prerequisites 2.3 NDVI Calculation 2.4 NDVI Visualization 2.5 Chart: NDVI Time Series 2.6 Exporting NDVI Data 2.7 Conclusion", " Chapter 2 NDVI Calculation with Sentinel-2 in Google Earth Engine 2.1 Introduction In this chapter, we will demonstrate how to calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) using Sentinel-2 imagery in Google Earth Engine (GEE). NDVI is a widely used index for monitoring vegetation health, and Sentinel-2 provides high-resolution imagery that is ideal for such analysis. 2.2 Prerequisites Before you begin, ensure that you have access to Google Earth Engine and have set up your environment. For the analysis, we’ll use Sentinel-2 imagery, which is available in Google Earth Engine’s public data catalog. 2.3 NDVI Calculation To calculate NDVI, we need to use the red and near-infrared bands (B4 and B8 for Sentinel-2). The formula for NDVI is: \\[ \\text{NDVI} = \\frac{\\text{B8} - \\text{B4}}{\\text{B8} + \\text{B4}} \\] 2.3.1 Code Example: NDVI Calculation // Define the region of interest (ROI) var roi = ee.Geometry.Polygon( [[[4.5, 50.5], [4.5, 51.0], [5.0, 51.0], [5.0, 50.5]]]); // Define the time period for Sentinel-2 data var startDate = &#39;2023-01-01&#39;; var endDate = &#39;2023-03-01&#39;; // Load Sentinel-2 imagery for the time period var sentinel2 = ee.ImageCollection(&#39;COPERNICUS/S2&#39;) .filterBounds(roi) .filterDate(startDate, endDate) .filter(ee.Filter.lt(&#39;SCL&#39;, 8)) // Filter clouds .select([&#39;B4&#39;, &#39;B8&#39;]); // Select red and NIR bands // Calculate NDVI var ndvi = sentinel2.map(function(image) { return image.normalizedDifference([&#39;B8&#39;, &#39;B4&#39;]).rename(&#39;NDVI&#39;); }); // Visualize the NDVI Map.centerObject(roi, 10); Map.addLayer(ndvi.mean(), {min: -1, max: 1, palette: [&#39;blue&#39;, &#39;white&#39;, &#39;green&#39;]}, &#39;NDVI&#39;); // Display the result on the map print(&#39;NDVI image:&#39;, ndvi.mean()); 2.4 NDVI Visualization The NDVI values are displayed on the map using a color palette, where blue represents lower NDVI (bare or water) and green represents higher NDVI (healthy vegetation). You can adjust the min, max, and color palette for a better visualization depending on the region. 2.5 Chart: NDVI Time Series In addition to visualizing NDVI on the map, you can create a time series chart to analyze the temporal changes in vegetation health. The following code generates a time series chart of the mean NDVI for the region of interest over the specified time period. // Calculate mean NDVI over the region of interest var meanNDVI = ndvi.mean().reduceRegion({ reducer: ee.Reducer.mean(), geometry: roi, scale: 10 }); // Print the mean NDVI value for reference print(&#39;Mean NDVI:&#39;, meanNDVI); // Generate the time series chart var chart = ui.Chart.image.series({ imageCollection: ndvi, region: roi, reducer: ee.Reducer.mean(), scale: 10, xProperty: &#39;system:time_start&#39; }).setOptions({ title: &#39;NDVI Time Series&#39;, vAxis: {title: &#39;NDVI&#39;}, hAxis: {title: &#39;Date&#39;}, lineWidth: 1, pointSize: 3 }); // Display the chart print(chart); 2.6 Exporting NDVI Data You can also export the NDVI data as a GeoTIFF file for further analysis in other GIS software. Here’s how to export the mean NDVI image: // Define the export task for the mean NDVI image Export.image.toDrive({ image: ndvi.mean(), description: &#39;NDVI_Export&#39;, scale: 10, region: roi, fileFormat: &#39;GeoTIFF&#39;, maxPixels: 1e8 }); This will export the calculated mean NDVI as a GeoTIFF file to your Google Drive. 2.7 Conclusion In this chapter, we’ve successfully calculated and visualized NDVI using Sentinel-2 imagery in Google Earth Engine. We also created a time series chart and demonstrated how to export the data for further use. NDVI is a powerful tool for monitoring vegetation health, and Google Earth Engine provides an efficient platform for such analyses.

Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 3. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 3.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively.

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 7.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.
